# Special Cases

Each country may require specific rules when organising project data. Minor adjustments can be made as long as they follow the general standards described above.

## Working with multiple people

When more than one person works within the same country folder, records must be carefully separated and assigned unique MAEASaM identifiers. Clear communication between team members is essential, but memory and assumptions are unreliable. As the Latin phrase reminds us: *Verba volant, scripta manent* — spoken words fly away, written ones remain. To avoid confusion, decisions must be documented and followed consistently.

At the start of dataset preparation, team members should:

1. Divide the records among themselves.  
2. Record assignments using the Data Tracker template.  

The Data Tracker consists of the following columns:

- **Data Group** (e.g. Site Data, Remote Sensing, Media)  
- **Responsible Person** (initials or name)  
- **MAEASaM ID** (incremental, country-specific identifiers)  
- **Name** (record name or short description)  
- **File Name** (working file name, see File Naming)  
- **Deadline** (date of expected submission)  

### Example – Data Tracker

| Data Group | Responsible Person | MAEASaM ID       | Name               | File Name            | Deadline   |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Site Data  | PO                | SITE-KEN-00000001 | Site Name Example 1 | KEN_SiteMetadata_PO  | 31/10/2025 |
| Site Data  | PO                | SITE-KEN-00000002 | Site Name Example 2 | KEN_SiteMetadata_PO  | 31/10/2025 |
| Site Data  | AK                | SITE-KEN-00000003 | Site Name Example 3 | KEN_SiteMetadata_AK  | 31/10/2025 |
| Site Data  | AK                | SITE-KEN-00000004 | Site Name Example 4 | KEN_SiteMetadata_AK  | 31/10/2025 |

You can define your **Data Group** as *Site Data*, *Remote Sensing*, or *Media*.  
The **Responsible Person** column should contain the name or initials of the team member preparing the dataset.  

The **MAEASaM ID** column is where you create incremental identifiers specific to your country.  

***Format:***

SITE-CountryCode-#########

***Example:***

SITE-KEN-00000001

Each ID must be paired with a corresponding entry in the **Name** column, which provides a clear description of the record.  

The **File Name** column should indicate the actual working file where the record is stored, so others can directly locate it in the heritage folder. **Do not include the date** in *yyyymmdd* format (see [*File Naming*](04.01_file-naming.md)) since these are working files and are expected to be updated every time you make changes. This approach is especially useful when splitting files into batches for easier organisation.  

Finally, the **Deadline** column specifies the date by which the dataset should be ready.

## Working with multiple batches

In some cases, a country folder may contain very large numbers of records, or information needs to be divided into smaller sets to allow efficient ingestion, checking, and correction. In such cases, data can be organised into batches while still tracked through the same Data Tracker logic.  

For batches, apply the file naming convention with a batch number:  

***Format:***

yyyymmdd_Group_Title_b##_Initials_v##.format

***Example:***

20250913_KEN_SitePoints_b01_LB_v01.xlsx

### Example – Data Tracker with batches

| Data Group | Responsible Person | MAEASaM ID       | Name               | File Name                  | Deadline   |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| Site Data  | PO                | SITE-KEN-00000001 | Site Name Example 1 | KEN_SiteMetadata_b01_PO    | 31/10/2025 |
| Site Data  | PO                | SITE-KEN-00000002 | Site Name Example 2 | KEN_SiteMetadata_b01_PO    | 31/10/2025 |
| Site Data  | AK                | SITE-KEN-00000003 | Site Name Example 3 | KEN_SiteMetadata_b01_AK    | 31/10/2025 |
| Site Data  | AK                | SITE-KEN-00000004 | Site Name Example 4 | KEN_SiteMetadata_b01_AK    | 31/10/2025 |
| Site Data  | PO                | SITE-KEN-00000005 | Site Name Example 5 | KEN_SiteMetadata_b02_PO    | 31/12/2025 |
| Site Data  | AK                | SITE-KEN-00000006 | Site Name Example 6 | KEN_SiteMetadata_b02_AK    | 31/12/2025 |

In this example:  
- **PO** manages batch 01 (Site IDs 001–002) with a deadline of 31/10/2025, and batch 02 (Site ID 005) with a deadline of 31/12/2025.  
- **AK** prepares batch 01 (Site IDs 003–004) with a deadline of 31/10/2025, and another file in batch 02 (Site ID 006) with a deadline of 31/12/2025.  

This table shows only six records for clarity. In practice, batches may include 50, 100, or more records depending on project requirements.  

### Using Subtitles for Batch Differentiation:

Sometimes, different subtitle formats can be used to separate batches, such as by country name, data group, or grid reference:

- KEN_SiteMetadata_Demo_AK
- KEN_SiteMetadata_Mombasa_AK
- SDN_RSMetadata_E27.6N15.3_TA

Esecially when working with **remote sensing data**, batches **must be** organized according to grid references to facilitate processing and tracking.
