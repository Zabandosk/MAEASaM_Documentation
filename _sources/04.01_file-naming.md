# File Naming

File names provide essential information about a document without opening it. Standard elements include:

- Date (YYYYMMDD)
- Country code or group identifier
- File title
- Initials of the person who prepared it
- Version number

Format:
yyyymmdd_Group_Title_Initials_v##.format

Example:
20250806_GAM_SitePoints_LB_v01.shp

This name indicates that the file was created on 06/08/2025. “GAM” is the country code for Gambia, “SitePoints” refers to heritage sites, “LB” are the initials of the contributor (Lamine Badji), and “v01” is the version number. The extension “.shp” shows it is a shapefile.
The use of YYYYMMDD ensures chronological sorting by machines. It also provides a practical versioning system.

- Create a new copy of the file each day you work on it, using the current date. This ensures older versions remain available.
- Avoid spaces and special characters (e.g., ^, &, %, ‘, “). These can cause problems in some systems, including Arches.

File naming standards can be applied to all types of data and are especially useful during ongoing work, as they make it easier to manage files on the journey to a final version.
For external media or resources (files that you did not create yourself), the date, initials, and version number should be omitted. Instead, assign a unique ID and a short descriptive name to ensure clarity and consistency.
